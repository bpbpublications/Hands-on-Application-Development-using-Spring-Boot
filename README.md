## About the Book
Spring is an excellent framework for developing both web and cloud-native applications. This book on application development using Spring Boot simplifies the process of writing boilerplate code for complex software. It allows developers to concentrate on the application's concept rather than on the internal Java configuration.

This book will guide you on how to make the best use of the strength that Spring Boot provides. You'll gain an understanding of how Spring Boot configuration works in conjunction with application development, including auto-configuration and overriding default configurations. You will learn to develop scalable, dependable microservices to accelerate the development lifecycle of a cloud-based application. Each chapter will walk you through the features of Spring Boot as a Software Development Framework, such as performing Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on a database and securing web services with appropriate logging.

By the end of this book, you will develop, test, and deploy applications ready for production and how to establish them as cloud-based applications. The readers will also gain the expertise of writing unit and integration test cases.
